Dear <%=h @application.user.name %>,

The Committee has chosen to approve a different application on <%=h @application.game.start_date.to_s%>.

This doesn't mean we don't like your application - please re-apply for a different game slot if another one suits.

If the approved GM has to drop out we will reconsider all applications remaining.

The details of your application are:

<%=h @application.details %>

Regards,
The Committee

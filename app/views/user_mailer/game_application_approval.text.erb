Dear <%=h @thing_approved.user.name %>,

The Committee has <%= (@thing_approved.approved ? "approved" : "rejected") %> your game application for <%=h @thing_approved.game.start_date.to_s%>. <%= (@thing_approved.approved ? "Have fun!" : "Please withdraw or edit your application.") %>

<%= if @thing_approved.approved? %>
Don't forget, as a GM you should:

- Start your debrief with 24hrs (and ideally 2hrs) of game end.
- Complete your debrief to at least a skeleton points level within:
  - Immediate follow on: 5 days (before the next game)
  - Standalone: 2 weeks
  - 24/36hr: 3 weeks
<%= end %>

Your monster point spend on <%= @character.name %> on <%= @spent_on %> has increased in cost.

Old cost: <%= @old_cost %>
New cost: <%= @new_cost %>

The additional cost has been deducted from your monster points. If you did not have enough monster points to cover this, then your monster point total will be negative until you earn more.
